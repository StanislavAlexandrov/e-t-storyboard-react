    'An old woman lives next door. Every morning she gets up at six and goes out for a long walk. In the afternoon she works in her garden, and in the evening she often goes to the movies. One day I asked her about her life. “I am a very happy person,” she told me “and do you know my secret? I have never been married!“';

    'Last Sunday some friends and I went out for a drive. We stopped in the country and had a picnic in the field and then drove to some woods and went for a walk. On the way home we stopped near a river and had a swim, then played soccer. When we got home in the evening we were all very tired but healthy and happy as well.';

    'When we were children, my brother and I loved playing tricks on our friends. In my bedroom there was a big cupboard built into the wall. My brother and I used to get into the cupboard and lock the door with our friends outside. There was a mattress at the back of the cupboard and we used to hide things behind it. We told our friends that the cupboard was an elevator, and that at the bottom of the elevator, there was a secret toy shop. When we came out of the cupboard we always had toys with us. I think our friends really believed it, and we nearly did, too!';
