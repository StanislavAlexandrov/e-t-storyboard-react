We told our friends that the cupboard was an elevator, and that at the bottom of the elevator, there was a secret toy shop. When we came out of the cupboard we always had toys with us. I think our friends really believed it, and we nearly did, too!';

Perhaps the most memorable time was week we spent in the mountains in the north west of China. We trekked miles each day amidst the most spectacular scenery and stayed with the local people in their tents. One family we stayed with wanted to know where we came from. When we explained we were from Europe they wanted to know which part of China it was in!',

            "A couple of years ago, my parents moved to a new house. One night in November they were woken up by the wind. They looked out of the window, it was very dark and it was pouring with rain. A typical English November night. They went back to bed but they could not sleep because of the storm. My mother was very worried, 'This new house cannot be very strong, she said, 'if it is this noisy in a storm.' When it got light they got up and looked out of the window. All the trees in the garden were lying on the ground. It was the night of the terrible hurricane in southern England.",
